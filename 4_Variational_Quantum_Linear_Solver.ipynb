    "Introduction\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We first define the problem and the general structure of a VQLS. As a\n",
    "second step, we consider a particular case and we solve it explicitly\n",
    "with PennyLane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a $2^n \\times 2^n$ matrix $A$ which can be expressed as a\n",
    "linear combination of $L$ unitary matrices $A_0, A_1, \\dots A_{L-1}$,\n",
    "i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} c_l A_l,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c_l$ are arbitrary complex numbers. Importantly, we assume that\n",
    "each of the unitary components $A_l$ can be efficiently implemented with\n",
    "a quantum circuit acting on $n$ qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also given a normalized complex vector in the physical form of a\n",
    "quantum state $|b\\rangle$, which can be generated by a unitary operation\n",
    "$U$ applied to the ground state of $n$ qubits. , i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|b\\rangle = U |0\\rangle,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where again we assume that $U$ can be efficiently implemented with a\n",
    "quantum circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that we aim to solve is that of preparing a quantum state\n",
    "$|x\\rangle$, such that $A |x\\rangle$ is proportional to $|b\\rangle$ or,\n",
    "equivalently, such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\Psi\\rangle :=  \\frac{A |x\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle x |A^\\dagger A |x\\rangle}} \\approx |b\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variational quantum linear solver\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach used in a VQLS is to approximate the solution $|x\\rangle$\n",
    "with a variational quantum circuit, i.e., a unitary circuit $V$\n",
    "depending on a finite number of classical real parameters\n",
    "$w = (w_0, w_1, \\dots)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|x \\rangle = V(w) |0\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters should be optimized in order to maximize the overlap\n",
    "between the quantum states $|\\Psi\\rangle$ and $|b\\rangle$. This suggests\n",
    "to define the following cost function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_G = 1- |\\langle b | \\Psi \\rangle|^2,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "such that its minimization with respect to the variational parameters\n",
    "should lead towards the problem solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we discuss two alternative methods which could be used to\n",
    "experimentally solve the minimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First method\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us write $C_G$ more explicitly:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_G = 1- \\frac{ \\sum_{l, l'}  c_l c_{l'}^* \\langle 0|  V^\\dagger A_{l'}^\\dagger U \\color{blue}{|0\\rangle \\langle 0|} U^\\dagger A_l  V |0\\rangle}\n",
    "{\\sum_{l,l'} c_l c_{l'}^* \\langle 0| V^\\dagger A_{l'}^\\dagger A_l V |0\\rangle} .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "All expectation values of the previous expression could be estimated\n",
    "with a [Hadamard\n",
    "test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_test_(quantum_computation)),\n",
    "which is a standard quantum computation technique. This method however\n",
    "might be experimentally challenging since it requires us to apply all\n",
    "the unitaries ($U^\\dagger, A_l$ and $V$) in a controlled way, i.e.,\n",
    "conditioned on the state of an ancillary qubit. A possible workaround\n",
    "for estimating the same expectation values in a simpler way has been\n",
    "proposed in Ref. \\[1\\], but will not be considered here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Second method\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method, which is the one used in this tutorial, is to\n",
    "minimize a \\\"local\\\" version of the cost function which is easier to\n",
    "measure and, at the same time, leads to the same optimal solution. This\n",
    "local cost function, originally proposed in Ref. \\[1\\], can be obtained\n",
    "by replacing the blue-colored projector\n",
    "$\\color{blue}{|0\\rangle\\langle 0|}$ in the previous expression with the\n",
    "following positive operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\color{blue}{P} =  \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2n}\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} Z_j,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z_j$ is the Pauli $Z$ operator locally applied to the $j\\rm{th}$\n",
    "qubit. This gives a new cost function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_L = 1- \\frac{ \\sum_{l, l'}  c_l c_{l'}^* \\langle 0|  V^\\dagger A_{l'}^\\dagger U \\color{blue}{P} U^\\dagger A_l  V |0\\rangle}\n",
    "{\\sum_{l,l'} c_l c_{l'}^* \\langle 0| V^\\dagger A_{l'}^\\dagger A_l V |0\\rangle},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which, as shown in Ref. \\[1\\], satisfies\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_G \\rightarrow 0   \\Leftrightarrow C_L \\rightarrow 0,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and so we can solve our problem by minimizing $C_L$ instead of $C_G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the definition of $P$ into the expression for $C_L$ we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "C_L\n",
    "&=& \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2n} \\frac{ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\sum_{l, l'}  c_l c_{l'}^* \\langle 0|  V^\\dagger A_{l'}^\\dagger U Z_j U^\\dagger A_l  V |0\\rangle}\n",
    "{\\sum_{l,l'} c_l c_{l'}^* \\langle 0| V^\\dagger A_{l'}^\\dagger A_l V |0\\rangle} \\\\\n",

    "{\\sum_{l,l'} c_l c_{l'}^* \\mu_{l,l',-1}},\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be computed whenever we are able to measure the following\n",
    "coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu_{l, l', j} = \\langle 0|  V^\\dagger A_{l'}^\\dagger U Z_j U^\\dagger A_l  V |0\\rangle,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we used the convention that if $j=-1$, $Z_{-1}$ is replaced with\n",
    "the identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also in this case the complex coefficients $\\mu_{l, l', j}$ can be\n",
    "experimentally measured with a Hadamard test. The corresponding quantum\n",
    "circuit is shown in the image at the top of this tutorial. Compared with\n",
    "the previous method, the main advantage of this approach is that only\n",
    "the unitary operations $A_l, A_l^\\dagger$ and $Z_j$ need to be\n",
    "controlled by an external ancillary qubit, while $V, V^\\dagger, U$ and\n",
    "$U^\\dagger$ can be directly applied to the system. This is particularly\n",
    "convenient whenever $V$ has a complex structure, e.g., if it is composed\n",
    "of many variational layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A simple example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we consider the following simple example based on a\n",
    "system of 3 qubits (plus an ancilla), which is very similar to the one\n",
    "experimentally tested in Ref. \\[1\\]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "A  &=  c_0 A_0 + c_1 A_1 + c_2 A_2 = \\mathbb{I} + 0.2 X_0 Z_1 + 0.2 X_0, \\\\\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "|b\\rangle &= U |0 \\rangle = H_0  H_1  H_2 |0\\rangle,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z_j, X_j, H_j$ represent the Pauli $Z$, Pauli $X$ and Hadamard\n",
    "gates applied to the qubit with index $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is computationally quite easy since a single layer of local\n",
    "rotations is enough to generate the solution state, i.e., we can use the\n",
    "following simple ansatz:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|x\\rangle = V(w) |0\\rangle = \\Big [  R_y(w_0) \\otimes  R_y(w_1) \\otimes  R_y(w_2) \\Big ]  H_0  H_1  H_2 |0\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
