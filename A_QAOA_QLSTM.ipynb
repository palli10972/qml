    "Problem: Optimization of Variational Quantum Algorithms\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, a big effort by the quantum computing community has been\n",
    "devoted to the study of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) which\n",
    "leverage quantum circuits with fixed shape and tunable parameters. The\n",
    "idea is similar to classical neural networks, where the weights of the\n",
    "network are optimized during training. Similarly, once the shape of the\n",
    "variational quantum circuit is chosen --- something that is very\n",
    "difficult and sensitive to the particular task at hand --- its tunable\n",
    "parameters are optimized iteratively by minimizing a cost (or loss)\n",
    "function, which measures how good the quantum algorithm is performing\n",
    "(see for a thorough overview on VQAs).\n",
    "\n",
    "A major challenge for VQAs relates to the optimization of tunable\n",
    "parameters, which was shown to be a very hard task, . Parameter\n",
    "initialization plays a key role in this scenario, since initializing the\n",
    "parameters in the proximity of an optimal solution leads to faster\n",
    "convergence and better results. Thus, a good initialization strategy is\n",
    "crucial to promote the convergence of local optimizers to local extrema\n",
    "and to select reasonably good local minima. By local optimizer, we mean\n",
    "a procedure that moves from one solution to another by small (local)\n",
    "changes in parameter space. These are opposed to global search methods,\n",
    "which take into account large sections of parameter space to propose a\n",
    "new solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such strategy could come from the classical machine learning\n",
    "literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Classical Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "---------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "By building on results from the *meta-learning* literature in machine\n",
    "learning, authors in propose to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as\n",
    "a black-box controller to optimize the parameters of variational quantum\n",

    "and by training the weights of the recurrent neural network to minimize\n",
    "the loss function $y_t$, a good initialization heuristic is found for\n",
    "the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ of the variational quantum circuit.\n",
    "\n",

    "$\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_t$ for which the variational circuit was evaluated.\n",
    "The RNN at this time step also receives information stored in its\n",
    "internal hidden state from the previous time step $\\boldsymbol{h}_t$.\n",
    "The RNN itself has trainable parameters $\\phi$, and hence it applies the\n",
    "parametrized mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{h}_{t+1}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t+1} = \\text{RNN}_{\\phi}(\\boldsymbol{h}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}, y_{t}),$$\n",

    "eventually learns a good heuristic to suggest optimal parameters for the\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Use the proposed architecture for VQAs other than QAOA for MaxCut.\n",
    "    You can check the paper to get some inspiration.\n",
    "-   Scale up the simulation, using bigger graphs and longer recurrent\n",
    "    loops.\n",
    "-   While working correctly, the training routine is quite basic and it\n",
    "    could be improved for example by implementing batch learning or a\n",
    "    stopping criterion. Also, one could implement the *observed\n",
    "    improvement* loss function, as used in the original paper .\n",
    "-   Depending on the problem, you may wish to transform the functions\n",
    "    `rnn_iteration` and `recurrent_loop` to actual `Keras Layers` and\n",
    "    `Models`. This way, by compiling the model before the training takes\n",
    "    place, `TensorFlow` can create the computational graph of the model\n",
